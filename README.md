# HCL: Hermes Container Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HDFGroup/hcl.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/HDFGroup/hcl)

In order to keep up with the demand for high performance at extreme-scale,
applications have become very highly distributed. Distributed applications
typically require global coordination for distributed algorithms such as stencil
computations, collective I/O, tridiagonal systems, etc. This coordination is
achieved using mechanisms such as inter-process communication, global
distributed coordinators, or leader election. These coordination mechanisms
require storing state information for consistent global access by multiple
processes via distributed data structure platforms. In order to facilitate the
coordination of applications at extreme-scale, we propose Hermes Container
Library (HCL), a user-space platform for distributing data structures. HCL
provides wrappers for C++ Standard Library (STL) containers, which it
distributes and manages transparently across nodes. HCL has been designed to be
easy-to-use, highly programmable, and portable. Data access is optimized via a
hybrid data model of shared memory and RPC. It supports decoupled and ephemeral
deployment models, with deployment configured based on application requirements.
It's primary goals are to provide

* a familiar STL-like interface
* a flexible programming paradigm
* a hybrid data access model optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC)
* a high-performance data container infrastructure that leverages new hardware and software innovations (e.g., RDMA, RoCE, one-sided communications)

HCL consists of the following templated data structures:

 * global_clock
 * map
 * multimap
 * priority_queue
 * queue
 * global_sequence (sequencer)
 * set
 * unordered_map

## Compilation

The HCL Library compiles with cmake, so the general procedure is

```bash
cd hcl
mkdir build
cmake -HCL_ENABLE_RPCLIB=true ..
make
sudo make install
```
If you want to install somewhere besides `/usr/local`, then use

```bash
cd hcl
mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/wherever -DHCL_ENABLE_RPCLIB=true ..
make
make install
```

A flag should be added to cmake to indicate the preferred RPC library, otherwise
compilation will fail. If compiling with RPCLib, use `-DHCL_ENABLE_RPCLIB`. If
compiling with Thallium, use either `-DHCL_ENABLE_THALLIUM_TCP` or
`-DHCL_ENABLE_THALLIUM_ROCE`

### Dependencies
- MPI
- Boost (interprocess module)
- RPC layer (pick one and compile appropriately)
  - rpclib
  - Thallium (wrapper over Mercury)
- glibc (for librt and posix threads)

#### Recommended Versions

HCL has been tested with mpich 3.3.1, boost 1.69.0, rpclib 2.2.1, mercury 1.0.1,
margo 0.5, and thallium 0.4.0. Please consider patching mercury using the patch
specified below, especially if you're using the Thallium RoCE transport. Also of
note is that we uses libfabric (ofi) as the default Mercury transport (for TCP
and RoCE (verbs)). We used libfabric version 1.8.x. If you would rather use a
different Mercury transport, please change the configuration via
include/hcl/common/configuration_manager.h. The TCP_CONF string is used for tcp
via Mercury, and the VERBS_CONF string is for verbs via Mercury. The
VERBS_DOMAIN is the domain used for RoCE.

## Usage

Since libhcl uses MPI, data structures have to be declared on the server and
clients. In the `test` directory, you will find examples of how to use each data
structure, and also for the clock and sequencer. Data structures typically
assume that we are running the server and clients on the same node, but this
need not be the case. You can easily configure clients to work with servers that
are not on their node.

### Structure Initialization

Structure configuration is managed via the following macros:

``` c++
HCL_CONF->IS_SERVER = is_server;
HCL_CONF->MY_SERVER = my_server;
HCL_CONF->NUM_SERVERS = num_servers;
HCL_CONF->SERVER_ON_NODE = server_on_node || is_server;
HCL_CONF->SERVER_LIST_PATH = "./server_list";
```

 * `IS_SERVER`: `true` when the data structure in the current process will act as a
   server (store the internal data structure), `false` otherwise.

 * `MY_SERVER`: The relative rank of your server (if servers are on ranks 3 and
   5, server relative ranks are still 0 and 1)

 * `NUM_SERVERS`: The total number of servers.

 * `SERVER_ON_NODE`: `true` when `MY_SERVER` is on the same node as the current process.

 * `SERVER_LIST_PATH`: An absolute or relative path to a file that lists
   `NUM_SERVERS` hostnames or addresses, one per line, of the server processes.

Constructor example:

``` c++
hcl::unordered_map(std::string name);
```

 * `name`: A unique name used to identify the shared memory.
